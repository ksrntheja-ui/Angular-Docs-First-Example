<h2>Products</h2>

<!--
Each product in the list displays the same way, one after another on the page.
  To iterate over the predefined list of products, put the *ngFor directive on a <div>

With *ngFor, the <div> repeats for each product in the list.

*ngFor is a "structural directive".
Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure,
typically by adding, removing, and manipulating the elements to which they are attached.

Any directive with an asterisk, *, is a structural directive.
-->

<div *ngFor="let product of products">

  <!--
  To display the names of the products,
    use the interpolation syntax {{ }}.

  Interpolation renders a property's value as text
    -->

  <h3>

    <!--    To make each product name a link to product details,
        add the <a> element and set its title to be the
        product's name by using the
        property binding [ ] syntax-->

    <!-- Interpolation {{ }} lets you
     render the
     property value as text;

     property binding [ ] lets you use the
     property value in a
     template expression.-->

    <a [title]="product.name + ' details'">

      {{ product.name}}

    </a>

  </h3>

  <!--On the <p> element, use an
  *ngIf directive so that Angular only creates the <p> element
  if the current product has a description.-->

  <p *ngIf="product.description">
    Description: {{ product.description }}
  </p>

</div>
